Boid refactoring
================

Master branch contains a deliberately bad implementation of [Boids](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=37401.37406)
for use as an exercise on refactoring.

Refactored versions exist in separate branches:
e.g.: A version optimised in NumPy is available in the perform branch.
